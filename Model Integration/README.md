# ü¶ø Human‚ÄìExoskeleton Gait Model Integration

This repository provides the model integration of a musculoskeletal human (MyoLeg) and an 18-DOF exoskeleton in the MuJoCo simulation environment. This framework forms the structural foundation for human‚Äìrobot gait synchronization, enabling personalized exoskeleton simulation through tendon-based coupling and parameter scaling.

## üß† What It Does

- Combines MyoSuite's musculoskeletal human model (`myoleg`) with a custom exoskeleton model
- Binds anatomical joint sites using tendons to enable interactive, coordinated movement
- Allows parametric scaling based on human anthropometric data
- Generates multiple model configurations
- Outputs XML models for use in control training (see [`legcontrol`](https://github.com/kekellyu/legcontrol))
